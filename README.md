## Cybersecurity
- **Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, combining technology, processes, and human awareness to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

- **Network Security:** Protects computer networks from intrusions, malware, and unauthorized access

- **Information Security:** Maintains the integrity and privacy of data in storage and transit.

- **Application Security:** Ensures software and applications are free from vulnerabilities that could expose sensitive data.

- **Operational Security:** Covers processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets, including user permissions and data storage protocols.

 ### Why Cybersecurity is Important
- **Cybersecurity** is critical because *cyberattacks* can disrupt operations, cause financial loss, compromise sensitive information, and damage reputations. For individuals, threats include identity theft, financial fraud, and privacy invasion. 
- For organizations, attacks can result in operational disruption, data breaches, and loss of trust. Globally, cybercrime is projected to cost the economy trillions of dollars annually, highlighting the need for robust security measures.
